- make more abstract interface to db service. For now PrismaService is used. I want to abstract to DbService in order to switch to TypeOrm for example
- migrate userId from number to smth more suitable and production ready
- add try-catch where appropriate
- maybe we should not respond with 400 on the consequtive run logout with error 'User is already logged out'
- maybe we should store not the hash of refresh token bur access token
- create constants for all strings
- implement guard for '/refresh' endpoint when we logged out bu try to refresh token with some refresh token. For now errro in bcrypt.compare with empty refresh token from user record
- also refresh works when run two times with the same refresh token - which should not work as we refreshed the token the old one should not work
- implement endpoint GET /user/me
- store some secrets not in .env (development mode) but in github (production mode)
